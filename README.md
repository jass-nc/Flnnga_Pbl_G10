Handwritten Digit Recognition using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
Project Overview
This project aims to build a Handwritten Digit Recognition system using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The system is designed to recognize digits (0-9) from handwritten input images. The ANN is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits. The project demonstrates how deep learning models, specifically ANNs, can be used for image classification tasks.

Key Features
Artificial Neural Network (ANN): A simple feedforward neural network is used for the classification task.
MNIST Dataset: The network is trained and tested on the popular MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.
Digit Prediction: Given a handwritten digit image, the model predicts the digit by outputting a class between 0-9.
Accuracy Evaluation: The model's accuracy is evaluated on the test set, and performance metrics such as loss and accuracy are provided.
Python & Deep Learning Libraries: Uses Python with popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
